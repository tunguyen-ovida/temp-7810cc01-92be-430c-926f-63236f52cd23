### Skill Definition (for you to demonstrate)

# Skill Description  

## Methodological Context  
This skill is part of leadership development in professional services, drawing on multiple questioning frameworks including the Five Domains, GROW, MBS, Fierce Conversations, SBI-BI, SPIN Selling, and Adaptive & Compassionate Leadership approaches.  

---

## 1. Brief Summary of the Skill  
Learn to diagnose any leadership conversation in real-time and deploy the precise questioning framework needed to drive clarity, unlock insight, and build stronger relationships. Move beyond giving answers to architecting the conversations that matter.  

---

## 2. Detailed Description of the Skill  
This skill equips leaders in professional services with the ability to master "The Right Question at the Right Time." It is built on the core principle of diagnostic-led inquiry: the idea that masterful questioning begins with an accurate diagnosis of the conversational context.  

The skill operates on a Dual-Axis Model, teaching leaders to consciously manage both the Task Goal (what must be achieved) and the Relationship Goal (how trust and influence are built) in every interaction. It provides a comprehensive map of the professional services environment, organizing all dialogues into Five Core Conversational Arenas: Client Engagement & Delivery, Team Leadership & Performance, Strategic Leadership & Alignment, and Career & Personal Development.  

For each context, the skill provides a specific tool from a comprehensive Questioning Toolkit. This includes frameworks for high-stakes strategic planning (The Five Domains), in-the-moment coaching (MBS Model), formal development planning (GROW Model), navigating difficult feedback (Fierce Conversations & SBI-BI), and leading through ambiguity (Adaptive & Compassionate Leadership techniques). The ultimate aim is to develop a leader's "state-shifting agility"—the ability to fluidly transition between these frameworks as a conversation evolves dynamically. Applying this skill transforms a leader from a mere participant in conversations to a strategic architect of them.  

---

## 3. Guidelines on When the Skill Should Be Deployed  
This skill is applicable to the full spectrum of leadership conversations within a professional services firm. The core diagnostic principles should be active at all times. The specific tools and frameworks within the skill are deployed based on the diagnosed context, as outlined in The Leader's Inquiry Matrix (see Part III).  

- Deploy the Foundational Skills of Inquiry as the default in all conversations.  
- Deploy the Five Domains framework for strategic planning, innovation workshops, and complex problem-solving sessions.  
- Deploy the MBS Model for daily, informal one-on-ones, and when a team member presents an immediate challenge or problem to be solved.  
- Deploy the GROW Model for formal, planned conversations focused on future goals, such as annual performance reviews and career development discussions.  
- Deploy the Fierce Conversations and SBI-BI models when delivering difficult corrective feedback or addressing a significant behavioral issue.  
- Deploy the Adaptive & Compassionate Leadership questions when facing complex challenges that require a shift in mindsets, not just a technical solution, and when managing the human element of change.  
- Deploy the Curiosity Check as a mandatory preparatory step before any high-stakes conversation where disagreement is likely or emotions may run high.  

---

## 4. Guidelines for How the Skill Should Be Deployed  

### Preparation (The Internal Stance)  
Begin every high-stakes conversation with a personal Curiosity Check. Proactively use the five "Curiosity Sparks" to shift your own mindset from certainty to openness. This internal work is the most effective preparation for achieving a constructive outcome.  

### Delivery (The External Execution)  
The power of any question is mediated by its delivery. Ground your questioning in the Principles of Delivery (Active Listening, Pacing, etc.) outlined in the Foundational Skills section.  

---

## 5. Tools and Practices  

### Tool 1: The Foundational Skills of Inquiry  
**Quote:** "Effective questions are the building blocks of any meaningful conversation."  

**Implementation:** Use this as the primary toolkit for all conversations. The goal is to master both the Forms of questions and their Delivery. A leader should create a natural conversational flow: start with an Open question to explore, use Probing questions to dig deeper, use Clarifying questions to confirm understanding, and use Closed questions to finalize a decision. All questions must be delivered with Active Listening, deliberate Pacing, and Clarity.  

**Practical Examples (1:1 Check-in):**  
- **Positive (Demonstrates Flow):**  
  - Leader (Open): "How is the marketing campaign project progressing?"  
  - Team Member: "It's going okay, but we've hit a bit of a snag with the stakeholder."  
  - Leader (Probing): "Tell me more about the snag. What specifically is happening?"  
  - Team Member: "Well, they keep changing their mind on the key messaging."  
  - Leader (Clarifying): "So the core issue isn't the work itself, but a lack of stable direction from the stakeholder. Is that right?"  
  - Team Member: "Exactly."  
  - Leader (Closed): "Okay. Will you commit to scheduling a meeting with them tomorrow to lock in the messaging?"  

- **Negative (Overuses Closed Questions):**  
  - Leader: "Is the marketing campaign on track?"  
  - Team Member: "Mostly."  
  - Leader: "Are there any problems?"  
  - Team Member: "Not really."  
  - Leader: "Okay, good."  

**Why it's negative:** The leader learns nothing of substance. The overuse of closed questions shuts down the conversation and fails to uncover the real issue.  

**Better Alternative:** Start with an open question, as shown in the positive example.  

---

### Tool 2: The Curiosity Check  
**Quote:** "The outcome of a high-stakes interaction is largely predetermined by the leader's mindset." — *Curiosity Article HBR*  

**Implementation:** While the check itself is an internal monologue, it directly impacts a leader's opening statements and questions.  

**Practical Examples (1:1 Conversations):**  
- **Positive (Shows Curiosity):** "I have some initial thoughts on the project delay, but I'm more interested in hearing your perspective first. Can you walk me through the challenges you're seeing from your side?"  
- **Negative (Shows a Lack of Curiosity):** "So, we both know the project is delayed because your team missed the deadline, right?"  

**Why it's negative:** This is a leading and accusatory question based on an unverified assumption.  

**Better Alternative:** "I'd like to talk about the project timeline. Can you help me understand the factors that led to the delay from your team's perspective?"  

---

### Tool 3: The Five Domains of Strategic Questioning  
**Quote:** "The most advanced skill is not just knowing the questions within each domain, but mastering the art of sequencing them to drive a conversation toward a robust and well-considered conclusion." — *The art of questions*  

**Implementation:** Use this as a mental map to structure a 1:1 coaching conversation about a complex problem. Ensure the conversation visits each domain.  

**Practical Examples (1:1 Coaching on a Client Problem):**  
- **Positive (Investigative):** "Before we start brainstorming solutions for the client's supply chain issue, let's be rigorous. What are the absolute, undeniable facts we have confirmed about their inventory system?"  
- **Negative (Jumping Domains):**  
  - Sam: "The client says their shipping is delayed."  
  - Leader: "Okay, so let's propose a new logistics partner for them."  

**Why it's negative:** The leader immediately jumps from a surface-level problem (Investigative) to a solution (Productive) without digging deeper.  

**Better Alternative:** "Delayed shipping is the symptom. Let's use the '5 Whys' to find the root cause. Why is it delayed? What's causing that?"  

---

### Tool 4: The Michael Bungay-Stanier (MBS) Model  
**Quote:** "Stay curious longer... tame the Advice Monster." — *Coaching for Performance Program_Models Handout*  

**Implementation:** Use this 7-question sequence for "in the moment" coaching when a team member brings you a problem.  

**Practical Examples (Team member is "swamped"):**  
- **Positive (The AWE Question):** "Okay, the quarterly report is on your mind. And what else?"  
- **Negative (Advice Monster):** "Okay, you're swamped. Have you tried time-blocking your calendar to focus on the report?"  

**Why it's negative:** The leader's "Advice Monster" has taken over.  

**Better Alternative:** "Okay, the report is taking up a lot of bandwidth. And what else is on your mind?"  

---

### Tool 5: The GROW Model  
**Implementation:** Use this 4-stage framework for proactive, 1:1 goal-oriented coaching conversations like career development or project planning.  

**Practical Examples (Career Conversation):**  
- **Positive (Goal):** "Maria, looking ahead 12–18 months, what would a 'win' look like for you in your career here?"  
- **Negative (Leading the Witness):** "So, what's your goal? Do you want to be a manager? Because there's an opening coming up."  

**Why it's negative:** This imposes the leader's agenda.  

**Better Alternative:** "As you think about the future, what are you hoping to achieve in your career?"  

---

### Tool 6: The SPIN Selling Framework  
**Implementation:** Use this 4-stage framework for consultative 1:1 client discovery conversations.  

**Practical Examples (Client Discovery):**  
- **Positive (Implication Question):** "You mentioned the data entry is a bottleneck. What is the productivity cost of that delay on the rest of the team?"  
- **Negative (Solution Jump):** "So you're unhappy with your current CRM. We have a great CRM solution that can fix that for you."  

**Why it's negative:** It pushes a product without fully exploring implications.  

**Better Alternative:** "That sounds frustrating. What are the wider effects of that data entry bottleneck?"  

---

### Tool 7: The Fierce Conversations & SBI-BI Models  
**Quote:** "Ask here: 'What was going on for you... in that moment?' This single question is transformative..." — *Coaching for Performance Program_Models Handout*  

**Implementation:** Use these models to structure difficult 1:1 feedback conversations.  

**Practical Examples (Giving Feedback):**  
- **Positive (SBI-BI):** "In our team meeting this morning (Situation), you interrupted Sarah twice (Behavior). The Impact on me was that it made the meeting feel tense. What was going on for you in that moment?"  
- **Negative (Judgmental):** "When you interrupt people, it makes you look rude."  

**Why it's negative:** This is a character judgment rather than an observation.  

**Better Alternative:** Use the SBI-BI model and invite perspective.  

---

### Tool 8: Adaptive & Compassionate Leadership Questions  
**Quote:** "In adaptive and compassionate leadership, asking questions is not about finding immediate answers. It's a tool to challenge beliefs, shift mindsets, and navigate complex, ambiguous challenges."  

**Implementation:** Use this suite of five questioning techniques in a 1:1 when you diagnose a challenge as adaptive rather than technical.  

**Practical Examples (Team Lead struggling with resistance to change):**  
- **Positive (Challenging Beliefs):** "I hear your frustration. How do you think this change challenges the team's core beliefs about 'the way we've always done things'?"  
- **Negative (Technical Solution for Adaptive Problem):** "The team just isn't using the new system." Leader: "Okay, let's just schedule more training for them."  

**Why it's negative:** This treats an adaptive challenge as a technical problem.  

**Better Alternative:** "It's tough when a team resists a change. What do you think they feel they are losing by giving up the old process?"  

---

### Tool 9: Client-Facing Sales Questions  
**Quote:** "In a relationship-driven sales culture, winning is not about having the best pitch; it's about having the best conversations."  

**Implementation:** Use this suite of questioning techniques to guide a 1:1 client conversation.  

**Practical Examples (Client Conversation):**  
- **Positive (Challenger Question):** "I understand the focus is on improving data accuracy. Our work with others in your sector suggests the bigger risk is data integration speed. Have you considered the impact that a 24-hour delay in data sync has on your sales team?"  
- **Negative (Direct Criticism):** "Your current process is really inefficient and outdated."  

**Why it's negative:** Direct criticism alienates the client.  

**Better Alternative:** "Many companies we work with start with a process similar to yours. We've found they often run into challenges around. Is that something you've experienced as well?"

| Criterion | Description |  
|:----------|:------------|  
| Context Diagnosis | The leader correctly identifies the primary purpose (Task & Relationship Goal) of the conversation and frames it appropriately. |  
| Framework Selection | The leader selects and deploys the appropriate primary questioning framework(s) for the diagnosed context. |  
| Tactical Execution | Within a chosen framework, the leader uses the key questions and mechanics effectively to maximize the framework's power. |  
| State-Shift Agility | The leader accurately identifies moments when the conversation's state changes and fluidly transitions to a more appropriate framework. |  
| Foundational Delivery | The leader's questions are supported by enabling behaviors like active listening, appropriate pacing, and an empathetic tone. |  

**Scoring Instructions:**  
- **Observed** – The behavior was demonstrated.  
- **Not Observed** – The behavior was not demonstrated.  

**LLM Assessment Guidance:** The LLM will assess the user's overall performance by holistically evaluating their demonstrated behaviors against the five criteria. Based on the frequency and effectiveness of these behaviors, the LLM will assign a single proficiency level from the 5-point scale below:  

- **Novice:** Just beginning; limited awareness of the skill.  
- **Emerging:** Some understanding; applies skill in simple situations but inconsistently.  
- **Developing:** Moderate competence; applies more consistently but needs support.  
- **Proficient:** Solid command; applies reliably across contexts.  
- **Mastery:** Skill is second nature; adapts flexibly and demonstrates excellence under pressure.
